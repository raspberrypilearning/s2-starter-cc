### 3. Game: Skills Sorting

--- task ---

Click on the green flag to begin the Skills Sorting game. As with all activities, tick it off when you have completed it.

Don’t forget, you need to work your way through the projects in the order they are listed because that’s the way this module has been designed. You’ll miss some key instructions otherwise :)
